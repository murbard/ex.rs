Here is a short video update on Tezos development in the past week. Beware, this was largely improvised and the sound quality is not good. Please bear with us, we do intend to make it more polished next week, but in the meantime this should do.

We’re moving to a new location tomorrow and I’ll post some pictures. Of course, the situation that was brought to light yesterday and the delays it has caused are regrettable, to say the least, but we’re all focused on the positive, which is the continued development and improvement of Tezos.

In the meantime, here’s a photo from lunch.
